## 📚 **Introduction**

This repository is a living document of my journey to master algorithms. It covers algorithms for **arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, greedy techniques, backtracking, and more**. Each algorithm is implemented in **Java** with clear explanations, input/output examples, and edge cases.

## 🚀 **How to Use This Repository**

- Browse the folders to view different algorithm categories.
- Each folder contains multiple files for specific algorithms with explanations.
- You can run the algorithms directly using **IntelliJ IDEA** or any other Java IDE.
- Look for the **README.md** files within subdirectories for specific details on the algorithms in that section.
